An experimental [programming
system](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf) that
combines modern research in programming languages and artificial
intelligence. Typed, purely functional concatenative code for
scripting the web â€” and others! With deep learning! ðŸš€

## About
Magic Word is a collection of compilers and services written in F# and
targeting the web platform. The common theme is **ABC**, a purely
functional bytecode designed for livecoding and program synthesis.

## Getting Started
`dotnet build` at the top-level will build all projects. At the moment
Magic Word is vaporware, but some time real soon, `dotnet run
--project ./src/MagicWord.Wiki` will start the wiki, which will walk
you through further configuration and usage.

`magic-word.sln` is a .NET solution containing a number of projects:

### `MagicWord.Functions`
`MagicWord.Functions` provides evaluators for the purely functional
bytecode, known as ABC, that powers the Magic Word project. Its unique
feature is its *rewriting* semantics, that allows programs to be
paused, migrated, and resumed at arbitrary points during execution.
  
### `MagicWord.Bots`
The Magic Word project takes the view that programming language theory
should embrace techniques based on statistics as well as
logic. `MagicWord.Bots` implements *neural language models* trained on
selected corpuses of ABC code. These models are used for program
synthesis, taking inspiration from several recent developments in
machine learning, such as [Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask
Learners](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf)
and [Neural Program Synthesis with Priority Queue
Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03526).

### `MagicWord.Wiki`
`MagicWord.Wiki` implements a web server that allows collaborative
community development of ABC programs.
  
### `MagicWord.Media`
`MagicWord.Media` implements conversions between ABC and various
multimedia formats: audio, images, video and so on. A typical example
is a function from infinite, continuous two dimensional space to some
color space being interpreted as an image (e.g. `R^2 -> R^4`).
