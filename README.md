Denshi is an experimental programming environment, intended to explore
applications of machine learning to the development of software.

Denshi uses a novel, purely functional bytecode known as
[ABCD](./doc/ABCD.md), developed as part of the [Awelon
project](https://github.com/dmbarbour/wikilon/blob/master/docs/AwelonLang.md).
