<p>
In <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf">The Structure of a Programming Language Revolution</a>, Gabriel draws a
distinction between <b>systems</b> and <b>languages</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A system is a set of interacting components, though sometimes the
interaction is in the realm of ideas—and thus a language can also be
a system. But the usual case requires a set of actual, observable
behavior. A real set of things doing real stuff. —Even if in a
computer.
</p>

<p>
A language is a system of signs but for the purpose of conveying
meaning. A language is words on the page. Grammatical correctness is
important to a language.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Gabriel also suggests that before the language paradigm rose to power,
the words "language" and "system" were used almost interchangeably in
the programming community. As an interesting example of this, I want
to draw attention to the Smalltalk language, and in particular the
article <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html">Design Principles Behind Smalltalk</a> published in BYTE Magazine,
1981, by one of the original Smalltalk contributors, Daniel Ingalls:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Operating System: An operating system is a collection of things that
don't fit into a language. There shouldn't be one.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples of conventional operating system components
that have been naturally incorporated into the Smalltalk language:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Storage management &#x2013; Entirely automatic. Objects are created by a
message to their class and reclaimed when no further references to
them exist. Expansion of the address space through virtual memory
is similarly transparent.
</li>

<li>File system &#x2013; Included in the normal framework through objects
such as Files and Directories with message protocols that support
file access.
</li>

<li>Display handling &#x2013; The display is simply an instance of class
Form, which is continually visible, and the graphical manipulation
messages defined in that class are used to change the visible
image.
</li>

<li>Keyboard Input &#x2013; The user input devices are similarly modeled as
objects with appropriate messages for determining their state or
reading their history as a sequence of events.
</li>

<li>Access to subsystems &#x2013; Subsystems are naturally incorporated as
independent objects within Smalltalk: there they can draw on the
large existing universe of description, and those that involve
interaction with the user can participate as components in the
user interface.
</li>

<li>Debugger &#x2013; The state of the Smalltalk processor is accessible as
an instance of class Process that owns a chain of stack
frames. The debugger is just a Smalltalk subsystem that has access
to manipulate the state of a suspended process. It should be noted
that nearly the only run-time error that can occur in Smalltalk is
for a message not to be recognized by its receiver.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Smalltalk has no "operation system" as such. The necessary primitive
operations, such as reading a page from the disk, are incorporated
as primitive methods in response to otherwise normal Smalltalk
messages.
</p>

Denshi is a <i>programming system</i>: a collection of tools that help you
perform computation. These includes a bytecode virtual machine with
several programming languages targeting it, sensors and acutators
connected to internet services, visualization of code and data, a
means of tracking the lifecycle of software objects etc.
