In [Incommensurability](), Gabriel draws a distinction between a
*system* and a *language*.

A system emphasizes *runtime*.

Wrt types: One program's compile time is another program's runtime.

The Knuth quote is a strong statement in favor of the language
paradigm. It's true that the language paradigm is the dominant one
today.

Neural networks are often criticized on the basis of failing to live
up to the demands on the language paradigm: they are considered "black
boxes".

This isn't such a big deal from a systems point of view. If you have a
good analysis of the network's behavior, with e.g. an abstract
interpretation, then you've got everything you need. There's no
lingering question of what the network "means".
