ABC is a text-based programming protocol. It's a cross between IRC and
FaaS: massively multiplayer livecoding. You connect to a server, where
you chat and write functions; the server executes all of the code,
providing results either in the channel or with a web service.

ABC is a continuation of the Smalltalk philosophy: Smalltalk expanded
a programming language until it absorbed the operating system, ABC
expands a programming language until it absorbs the network as well.
