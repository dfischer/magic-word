Magic Word is a hobbyist research & development project in programming
languages and machine learning. I would like to experiment with a
number of recent developments, including:

* combinatory term rewriting for mobile code
* [delimited continuations](http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/) for program structure
* neural language models for program synthesis

The organization of the documentation is as follows:

[Program Rewriting](program-rewriting.md)
[Arithmetic Types](arithmetic-types.md)
[Delimited Continuations](delimited-continuations.md)
[Open Deduction](open-deduction.md)
[Transactors](transactors.md)
[Neural Language Models](neural-language-models.md)
